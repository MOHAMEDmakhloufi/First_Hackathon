HACKATHON

Subject:

Since the latest events, with Facebook being down
and the emergence of new bugs in all social media
platforms, we decided to work on our own
communication platform.
In this Hackathon, you will be asked to develop a
web application that allows you to communicate
with your friends, share media with them and
view their profiles.
Your work will be judged as follows:

1- Authentication and security: your web app
should have at least some basic security with a
login and a password (the more security
added the better)
2- Basic CRUD: your web app should allow you
to add a new profile*, edit it and delete it.
3- Communication between profiles: each
profile should be able to communicate with
the others with simple messages or attach
other media such as images, audios, videos e
...
4- The global design of the app (UI/UX) is an
important aspect, unveil your creativity with
interactive and responsive interfaces.
